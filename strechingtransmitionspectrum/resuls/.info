ref = is reflactance which specifies where data belongs to
tra = transmission which specifies where data belongs to
in = is incident which specifies where data belongs to
pml = is thickness of pml and absorber layers
Ey = means source polarization is Ey
Ez = means source polarization is Ez
Ex = means source polarization is Ex
w = equal to wavelengths array in terms of nanometers
